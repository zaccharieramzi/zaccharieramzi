I am Zaccharie Ramzi, currently a PhD student working in 3 institutions: Inria in the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/), Neurospin in the [METRIC team](http://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin/unirs/METRIC.aspx), and the CEA astrophysics department in the [Cosmostat team](http://www.cosmostat.org/).

The topic of my PhD is deep learning for MRI reconstruction. This means I am interested in all things connected to:
- convex non-smooth optimization
- computer vision
- MRI
- deep learning

I like to write TensorFlow code not only to write neural networks but also to build smaller functionalities.
